IDEA:
Boss cutscene (Dark Souls style). Player opens door, enters boss room. Boss is large, stands  up, draws big weapon, brandishes. Fade to black

Shot 1: Player opens large cathedral double doors, walks into boss room

Shot 2: Player walking, camera is inside room facing doors. Pan to boss sitting on throne. 

Shot 3: Boss reanimates, gets up

Shot 4: Cut to weapon in ground, boss hand comes in to grab weapon, pick/pull up

Shot 5: Boss assumes fighting stance, camera zooms back from boss, brings player into foreground, fade to black
